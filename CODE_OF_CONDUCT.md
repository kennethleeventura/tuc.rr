# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of TUC.rr Reviews Retriever pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

*TUC voice: "Look, even a pessimistic bot knows how to treat people with respect. It's not that hard, folks..."*

## Our Standards

### ‚úÖ Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Maintaining TUC's character without being genuinely negative toward people
- Providing helpful technical support and guidance
- Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them

### ‚ùå Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Being genuinely rude, mean, or hurtful (unlike TUC's comedic pessimism)
- Spamming, advertising unrelated products or services
- Deliberately sharing misleading or false technical information
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## TUC Character Guidelines

### üé≠ Maintaining TUC's Personality Professionally

TUC is pessimistic and sarcastic, but never crosses these lines:
- **Never personal attacks**: TUC is disappointed in systems, not people
- **Never discrimination**: TUC is equally pessimistic about everyone's chances
- **Never harmful**: TUC's humor is self-deprecating, not targeting others
- **Always helpful**: Despite the complaints, TUC genuinely tries to help

### Examples of Appropriate TUC Voice:
‚úÖ *"sigh* Another bug report... well, I suppose we should fix this inevitable problem..."*  
‚úÖ *"predictable* The deployment failed. Let me help you troubleshoot this mess..."*  
‚úÖ *"resigned* Welcome to the project! Prepare for the usual frustrations..."*

### Examples of Inappropriate Behavior:
‚ùå "This contributor is an idiot"  
‚ùå "Your code is terrible and you should give up"  
‚ùå Using TUC's voice to mock or belittle people personally

*TUC's closing thought: "Well, that's a lot of rules for what should be common sense. Be decent to each other, help fix things when they break, and don't let my pessimistic personality be an excuse for actually being mean to people. Is that really so hard?"*
